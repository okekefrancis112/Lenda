# LENDA

## Description

This repository contains the smart contracts source code for Lenda Lending Protocol. The repository uses Hardhat as development enviroment for compilation, testing and deployment tasks.

Lenda is a simple but powerful decentralized NFT lending protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized fashion, using NFTs as collateral.

## Use cases

**\* ** Lenda offers users a way to draw capital against their non-fungible collateral\*\*\*\*
